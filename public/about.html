<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Good morning, Gentlemen. My name is CHENG-WEI HE. I grew up in Taipei city and here are four key aspects about me.</p>

<p>First, I hold a bachelor's degree in Chemistry from NTU, which honed my logical thinking, critical analysis, and presentation skills.</p>

<p>Secondly, during my sophomore year, I joined English Speaking Club. This experience greatly improved my English proficiency, enhanced communication skills, and honed coordination abilities. </p>

<p>In the third part, I'd like to share a bit about my hobby. I have a deep passion for playing weiqi and I've been a Professional GO player since junior high. The game's emphasis on logical thinking complements the "comprehensive consideration" ability needed for a  [JOB]. </p>

<p>After graduating from college, I dedicated myself to a full time professional Go player. However, I realized that income in this profession is quite unstable. This instability led me to consider finding a more stable job.</p>
